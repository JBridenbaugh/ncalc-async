# NCalcAsync

NCalcAsync is a fully async port of the [NCalc](https://github.com/ncalc/ncalc) mathematical expressions evaluator in .NET. NCalc can parse any expression and evaluate the result, including static or dynamic parameters and custom functions.

For general documentation refer to the NCalc wiki:
* [description](https://github.com/ncalc/ncalc/wiki/Description): overall concepts, usage and extensibility points
* [operators](https://github.com/ncalc/ncalc/wiki/Operators): available standard operators and structures
* [values](https://github.com/ncalc/ncalc/wiki/Values): authorized values like types, functions, ...
* [functions](https://github.com/ncalc/ncalc/wiki/Functions): list of already implemented functions
* [parameters](https://github.com/ncalc/ncalc/wiki/Parameters): on how to use parameters expressions

## API differences between NCalc and NCalcAsync

Expressions are evaluated using `Expression.EvaluateAsync()` instead of `Expression.Evaluate()`.

Async custom parameter and function handlers are assigned to `Expression.EvaluateParameterAsync` 
and `Expression.EvalauteFunctionAsync`, instead of adding event handlers.  They are asynchronous 
and thus return a `Task` but otherwise behave the same way as the handlers in NCalc, i.e. they set 
`args.Result` to pass back the result and indicate that it handled the symbol.  Multiple handlers 
can be added with `+=`, just like in NCalc.  They are awaited in order, so if one of them blocks 
the following handlers will not be called until it returns.

`FunctionArgs.EvaluateParametersAsync()` replaces `FunctionArgs.EvaluateParameters()`.

Custom `LogicalExpressionVisitor` implementations must be fully asynchronous.

The custom `LogicalExpression.ToString()` is removed.
